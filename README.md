# Intermittent burst generator plugin
The **Intermittent Burst Generator** plugin is designed to send stimulation events on a specified event channel for a certain number of pulses. After this burst of stimulation, it will enter a "Sham Duration" phase, where no stimulation pulses are sent. This cycle of stimulation and sham duration can be customized based on the userâ€™s requirements.

> However, please note: **_The plugin does not generate continuous stimulation signals. Instead, it produces stimulation signals based on specific events, such as the crossing of a certain phase, from the event occured in crossing detector. The stimulation occurs when the specified event or condition is met, not continuously._**

### Parameter:

- **Pulse Width (ms):**  
  Specifies the duration (in milliseconds) of each pulse triggered by the Intermittent Burst Generator. This pulse is sent through the channels specified in the JSON configuration file.

- **Sham Duration (s):**  
  Defines how long (in seconds) the sham pulses or events are sent. This value controls the duration of the sham period.

- **Stim Pulse:**  
  Specifies the number of stimulation pulses that must occur before the next sham period is activated. It determines how many stimulation pulses happen before a new sham event is triggered.


### Note
The json format is as follow 
Example: IN:OUT
```json
{
  "1": 1,
  "2": 2
}
```
where IN in the input event channel and OUT is the output event channel.

### Building the plugins
Building the plugins requires [CMake](https://cmake.org/). Detailed instructions on how to build open ephys plugins with CMake can be found in [our wiki](https://open-ephys.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OEW/pages/1259110401/Plugin+CMake+Builds).

### Installation

If you are building this plugin outside the `oep-installation` installation, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the `intermittent-burst-generator` folder**  
   This folder should be located next to the `Source` and `Build` folders.

2. **Open Git Bash**  
   Launch Git Bash or your preferred terminal.

3. **Create a `.gitignore` file**  
   Run the following command to create a `.gitignore` file:
   ```bash
   touch .gitignore
	```
	
4. **Navigate to the `Build` directory**
   ```bash
   cd Build
   ```
   Run the following command to create a `.gitignore` file:
   ```bash
   touch .gitignore
   ```
6. **Generate the project for your version**
	Run the following command to generate the Visual Studio project:
  
  ```bash
	cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 ..
  ```
7. **Build the project in Release mode**
	Run the following command to compile and build the Release version of the plugin:
  
  ```bash
	cmake --build . --config Release
  ```
8. **Install the plugin (copy DLLs to the correct folder)**
	To install the plugin and copy the generated DLLs to the appropriate folder, run:
  
  ```bash
	cmake --install . --config Release
  ```
